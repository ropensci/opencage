Geocoding is surprisingly hard.
Address formats and spellings differ in and between countries; administrative areas on different levels intersect; names, numbers, and boundaries change over time — you name it.
The OpenCage API, therefore, supports about a dozen parameters to customise queries.
This vignette explains how to use the query parameters with {opencage} to get better geocoding results.

## Multiple results

Forward geocoding typically returns multiple results because many places have the same or similar names.

By default `oc_forward_df()` only returns one result:
the one defined as the best result by the OpenCage API.
To receive more results, modify the `limit` argument, which specifies the maximum number of results that should be returned.
Integer values between 1 and 100 are allowed.

```{r limit1}
oc_forward_df("Berlin")
```
```{r limit2}
oc_forward_df("Berlin", limit = 5)
```


Reverse geocoding only returns [at most one result](https://opencagedata.com/api#ranking).
Therefore, `oc_reverse_df()` does not support the `limit` argument.

OpenCage may sometimes have more than one record of one place.
Duplicated records are not returned by default.
If you set the `no_dedupe` argument to `TRUE`, you will receive duplicated results when available.

```{r dedupe}
oc_forward_df("Berlin", limit = 5, no_dedupe = TRUE)
```

## Better targeted results

As you can see, place names are often ambiguous.
Happily, the OpenCage API has tools to deal with this problem.
The `countrycode`, `bounds`, and `proximity` arguments can make the query more precise.
`min_confidence` lets you limit the results to those with a specified confidence score (which is not necessarily the "best" or most "relevant" result, though).
These parameters are only relevant and available for forward geocoding.

### `countrycode`

The `countrycode` parameter restricts the results to the given country.
The country code is a two letter code as defined by the [ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) standard.
E.g. "AR" for Argentina, "FR" for France, and "NZ" for the New Zealand.

```{r countrycode}
oc_forward_df(placename = "Paris", countrycode = "US", limit = 5)
```
Multiple countrycodes per `placename` must be wrapped in a list.
Here is an example with places called "Paris" in Italy and Portugal.

```{r multiple_countrycode}
oc_forward_df(placename = "Paris", countrycode = list(c("IT", "PT")), limit = 5)
```

Despite the name, country codes also exist for territories that are not independent states, e.g. Gibraltar ("GI"), Greenland ("GL"), Guadaloupe ("GP"), or Guam ("GU").
You can look up specific country codes with the {[ISOcodes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ISOcodes)} or {[countrycodes](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/countrycode/)} packages or on the [ISO](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) webpages. In fact, you can also look up country codes via OpenCage as well. If you were interested in the country code of Curaçao for example, you could run:

```{r cc_curacao}
oc_forward_df("Curaçao", no_annotations = FALSE)["oc_iso_3166_1_alpha_2"]
```

### `bounds`

The `bounds` parameter restricts the possible results to a defined [bounding box](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bounding_Box).
A bounding box is a named numeric vector with four coordinates specifying its south-west and north-east corners: `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.
The bounds parameter can most easily be specified with the `oc_bbox()` helper. For example, `bounds = oc_bbox(-0.56, 51.28, 0.27, 51.68)`.
OpenCage provides a '[bounds-finder](https://opencagedata.com/bounds-finder)' to interactively determine bounds values.

Below is an example of the use of `bounds` where the bounding box specifies the the South American continent.

```{r bounds}
oc_forward_df(placename = "Paris", bounds = oc_bbox(-97, -56, -32, 12), limit = 5)
```

Again, you can also use {opencage} to determine a bounding box for subsequent queries.
If you wanted to see how many Plaça d'Espanya there are on the Balearic Islands, for example, you could find the appropriate bounding box and then search for the squares:

```{r balearic}
hi <- oc_forward_df(placename = "Balearic Islands", no_annotations = FALSE)

hi_bbox <-
  oc_bbox(
    hi$oc_southwest_lng,
    hi$oc_southwest_lat,
    hi$oc_northeast_lng,
    hi$oc_northeast_lat
  )

oc_forward_df(placename = "Plaça d'Espanya", bounds = hi_bbox, limit = 20)

```

Note that OpenCage does not support point-of-interest or feature search, like "show me all bus stops in this area". 
If you are more interested in these kind of features, you might want to take a look at the {[osmdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/)} package.

### `proximity`

The `proximity` parameter provides OpenCage with a hint to bias results in favour of those closer to the specified location.
It is just one of many factors used for ranking results, however, and (some) results may be far away from the location or point passed to the `proximity` parameter.
A point is a named numeric vector of a latitude and longitude coordinate pair in decimal format.
The `proximity` parameter can most easily be specified with the `oc_points()` helper.
For example, `proximity = oc_point(38.0, -84.5)`, if you happen to already know the coordinates.
If not, you can also look them up with {opencage}, of course:

```{r proximity}
lx <- oc_forward_df("Lexington, Kentucky")

lx_point <- oc_points(lx$oc_lat, lx$oc_lng)

oc_forward_df(placename = "Paris", proximity = lx_point, limit = 5)
```
Note that the French capital is listed before other places in the US, which are closer to the point provided.
This illustrates how `proximity` is only one of many factors influencing the ranking of results.

### Confidence

`min_confidence` — an integer value between 0 and 10 — indicates the precision of the returned result as defined by its geographical extent, i.e. by the extent of the result's bounding box.
When you specify `min_confidence`, only results with at least the requested confidence will be returned.
Thus, in the following example, the French capital is too large to be returned.

```{r confidence}
oc_forward_df(placename = "Paris", min_confidence = 7, limit = 5)
```

Note that confidence is not used for the [ranking of results](https://opencagedata.com/api#ranking).
It does not tell you which result is more "correct" or "relevant", nor what type of thing the result is, but rather how small a result is, geographically speaking.
See the [API documentation](https://opencagedata.com/api#confidence) for details.

## Retrieve more information from the API

Besides parameters to target your search better, OpenCage offers parameters to receive more or specific types of information from the API.

### `language`

If you would like to get your results in a specific language, you can pass an [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), such as "tr" for Turkish or "pt-BR" for Brazilian Portuguese, to the `language` parameter.
OpenCage will attempt to return results in that language.

```{r language_it}
oc_forward_df(placename = "Munich", language = "tr")
```

Alternatively, you can specify the "native" tag, in which case OpenCage will attempt to return the response in the "official" language(s) of the location.
Keep in mind, however, that some countries have more than one official language or that the official language may not be the one actually used day-to-day.

```{r language_native}
oc_forward_df(placename = "Munich", language = "native")
```

If the `language` parameter is set to `NULL` (which is the default), the tag is not recognized, or OpenCage does not have a record in that language, the results will be returned in English.

```{r language_null}
oc_forward_df(placename = "München")
```

To find the correct language tag for your desired language, you can search for the language on the [BCP47 language subtag lookup](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/) for example.
Note however, that there are some language tags in use on OpenStreetMap, one of OpenCage's main sources, that do not conform with the IETF BCP 47 standard.
For example, OSM uses [`zh_pinyin`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=Multilingual_names#China) instead of `zh-Latn-pinyin` for [Hanyu Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).
It might, therefore, be helpful to consult the details page of the target country on openstreetmap.org to see which language tags are actually used.
In any case, neither the OpenCage API nor the functions in this package will validate the language tags you provide.

For further details, see [OpenCage's API documentation](https://opencagedata.com/api#language).

### Annotations

OpenCage supplies additional information about the result location in what it calls [annotations](https://opencagedata.com/api#annotations).
Annotations include, among a variety of other types of information, country information, time of sunset and sunrise, [UN M49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_M49) codes or the location in different geocoding formats, like [Maidenhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System), [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) ([EPSG:3857](https://epsg.io/3857)), [geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) or [what3words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What3words).
Some annotations, like the [Irish Transverse Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Transverse_Mercator) (ITM, [EPSG:2157](https://epsg.io/2157)) or the [Federal Information Processing Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) (FIPS) code will only be shown when appropriate.

Whether the annotations are shown, is controlled by the `no_annotations` argument.
It is `TRUE` by default, which means that the output will _not_ contain annotations.
(Yes, inverted argument names are confusing, but we just follow OpenCage's lead here.)
When you set `no_annotations` to `FALSE`, all columns are returned (i.e. `output` is implicitly set to `"all"`).
This leads to a result with a lot of columns.

```{r annotations}
oc_forward_df("Dublin", no_annotations = FALSE)
```

### `roadinfo`

`roadinfo` indicates whether the geocoder should attempt to match the nearest road (rather than an address) and provide additional road and driving information.
It is `FALSE` by default, which means OpenCage will not attempt to match the nearest road.
Some road and driving information is nevertheless provided as part of the annotations (see above), even when `roadinfo` is set to `FALSE`.

```{r roadinfo}
oc_forward_df(placename = c("Europa Advance Rd", "Bovoni Rd"), roadinfo = TRUE)
```

A [blog post](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/new-optional-parameter-roadinfo) provides more details.

### Abbreviated addresses

The geocoding functions also have an `abbr` parameter, which is `FALSE` by default.
When it is `TRUE`, the addresses in the `formatted` field of the results are abbreviated (e.g. "Main St." instead of "Main Street").

```{r abbrev}
oc_forward_df("Wall Street")
oc_forward_df("Wall Street", abbrv = TRUE)
```

See [this blog post](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/160294347883/shrtr-pls) for more information.

### `address_only`

When `address_only` is set to `TRUE` (by default `FALSE`), OpenCage will attempt to exclude names of points-of-interests from the `formatted` field of the results. 
In the following example, the POI "Hôtel de ville de Nantes" (town hall of Nantes) is removed from the `oc_formatted` column with `address_only = TRUE`.

```{r address-only}
oc_reverse_df(47.21864, -1.55413)
oc_reverse_df(47.21864, -1.55413, address_only = TRUE)
```

## Vectorised arguments

All of the function arguments mentioned above are vectorised, so you can send queries like this:

```{r vectorised}
oc_forward_df(
  placename = c("New York", "Rio", "Tokyo"),
  language = c("es", "de", "fr")
)
```

Or geocode place names with country codes in a data frame:

```{r dataframe}
for_df <-
  data.frame(
    location = c("Golden Gate Bridge", "Buckingham Palace", "Eiffel Tower"),
    ccode = c("at", "cg", "be")
  )

oc_forward_df(for_df, placename = location, countrycode = ccode)
```

This also works with `oc_reverse_df()`, of course.

```{r rev_df}
rev_df <-
  data.frame(
    lat = c(51.952659, 41.401372),
    lon = c(7.632473, 2.128685)
  )

oc_reverse_df(rev_df, lat, lon, language = "native")
```
