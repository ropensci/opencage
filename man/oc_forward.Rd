\arguments{
\item{placename}{A character vector with the location names or addresses to
be geocoded.

If the locations are addresses, see \href{https://github.com/OpenCageData/opencagedata-misc-docs/blob/master/query-formatting.md}{OpenCage's instructions}
on how to format addresses for best forward geocoding results.}

\item{return}{A character vector of length one indicating the return value of
the function, either a list of tibbles (\code{df_list}, the default), a JSON
list (\code{json_list}), a GeoJSON list (\code{geojson_list}), or the URL with which
the API would be called (\code{url_only}).}

\item{bounds}{A list of bounding boxes of length one or \code{length(placename)}.
Bounding boxes are named numeric vectors, each with four coordinates
forming the south-west and north-east corners of the bounding box:
\code{list(c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax))}. \code{bounds} restricts the possible results
to the supplied region. It can be specified with the \code{\link[=oc_bbox]{oc_bbox()}} helper.
For example: \code{bounds = oc_bbox(-0.563160, 51.280430, 0.278970, 51.683979)}.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{proximity}{A list of points of length one or \code{length(placename)}. A
point is a named numeric vector of a latitude, longitude coordinate pair in
decimal format. \code{proximity} provides OpenCage with a hint to bias results
in favour of those closer to the specified location. It can be specified
with the \code{\link[=oc_points]{oc_points()}} helper. For example: \code{proximity = oc_points(51.9526, 7.6324)}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{countrycode}{A two letter code as defined by the \href{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code}{ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2} standard that restricts the
results to the given country or countries. E.g. "AR" for Argentina, "FR"
for France, "NZ" for the New Zealand. Multiple countrycodes per \code{placename}
must be wrapped in a list. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{language}{An \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag}{IETF BCP 47 language tag} (such as "es" for
Spanish or "pt-BR" for Brazilian Portuguese). OpenCage will attempt to
return results in that language. Alternatively you can specify the "native"
tag, in which case OpenCage will attempt to return the response in the
"official" language(s). In case the \code{language} parameter is set to \code{NULL}
(which is the default), the tag is not recognized, or OpenCage does not
have a record in that language, the results will be returned in English.}

\item{limit}{Numeric vector of integer values to determine the maximum number
of results returned for each \code{placename}. Integer values between 1 and 100
are allowed. Default is 10.}

\item{min_confidence}{Numeric vector of integer values between 0 and 10
indicating the precision of the returned result as defined by its
geographical extent, (i.e. by the extent of the result's bounding box). See
the \href{https://opencagedata.com/api#confidence}{API documentation} for
details. Only results with at least the requested confidence will be
returned. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{no_annotations}{Logical vector indicating whether additional
information about the result location should be returned. \code{TRUE} by
default, which means that the results will not contain annotations.}

\item{roadinfo}{Logical vector indicating whether the geocoder should attempt
to match the nearest road (rather than an address) and provide additional
road and driving information. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{no_dedupe}{Logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE} the results
will not be deduplicated.}

\item{abbrv}{Logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE} addresses in the
\code{formatted} field of the results are abbreviated (e.g. "Main St." instead
of "Main Street").}

\item{address_only}{Logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE} only the
address details are returned in the \code{formatted} field of the results, not
the name of a point-of-interest should there be one at this address.}

\item{add_request}{Logical vector (default \code{FALSE}) indicating whether the
request is returned again with the results. If the \code{return} value is a
\code{df_list}, the query text is added as a column to the results. \code{json_list}
results will contain all request parameters, including the API key used!
This is currently ignored by OpenCage if return value is \code{geojson_list}.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
Depending on the \code{return} argument, \code{oc_forward} returns a list with
either
\itemize{
\item the results as tibbles (\code{"df_list"}, the default),
\item the results as JSON specified as a list (\code{"json_list"}),
\item the results as GeoJSON specified as a list (\code{"geojson_list"}),
or
\item the URL of the OpenCage API call for debugging purposes
(\code{"url_only"}).
}

When the results are returned as (a list of) tibbles, the column names
coming from the OpenCage API are prefixed with \code{"oc_"}.
